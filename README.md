## 👀 THE TEA

Community Pulse is **that app** for finding what's poppin' in your hood without the corporate algorithm nonsense. We're all about hyper-local events that actually matter to you and your besties.

**NOT your boring calendar app** — Community Pulse hits different with curated local events that pass the vibe check.

## 💅 MAIN CHARACTER ENERGY

- **Post your own events** — garage sales, kickbacks, sport matches, yoga in the park, art workshops, clean-up drives, exhibitions, or whatever your community is into
- **Zero effort RSVPs** — none of that "fill out your life story" nonsense
- **Get notifications that matter** — we'll remind you about events without blowing up your phone
- **Location-aware** — only see what's relevant in your area (no more FOMO for events 50 miles away)
- **Edit/delete your events** — because we all change our minds sometimes

## 🔥 EVENT CATEGORIES (THE LINEUP)

- 👕 Garage Sales (thrift girlies rejoice)
- 🏆 Local Sports Matches (cricket, football, tennis, etc.)
- 🧘‍♀️ Community Classes (yoga, art, skill sharing)
- 🌱 Volunteer Opportunities (clean-up drives, donation drives)
- 🎨 Exhibitions (art? we got it)
- 🎉 Small Festivals (the underrated ones that actually slap)

## 🚨 HOW IT WORKS (NO CAP)

1. **Sign up** — basic info only, we're not data mining your soul
2. **Find events** — browse what's happening nearby
3. **Create events** — be the main character and start something
4. **RSVP** — just your name, email, phone, and how many homies you're bringing
5. **Get reminded** — we'll ping you 1 day before so you don't ghost

## 👑 ADMIN POWERS

The ops team keeps the platform from becoming toxic:

- Event approval system
- Content moderation
- User verification
- "Verified Organizer" status for the real ones
- Can yeet problematic users if necessary

## 🔮 COMING SOON
